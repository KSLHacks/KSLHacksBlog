Hi, I'm Kevin Leung, a Technical Evangelist at Microsoft focused on developer communities, Software Engineering solutions and sparking innovation.

You can think of my role as an engineer by night, public speaker by day (though, I don't have much superpowers). I truly enjoy deep diving in technology by helping students, startups and enterprises solve their most technically challenging problems while building content and demos to share the knowledge to a wider audience.  
_Check out my [projects](/page/projects) section for more on my technology focuses and what I'm currently up to._

You can find me at code camps, conferences and workshops around the US. I absolutely **love** teaching and connecting with others. That is core to who I am as a person.

### Fun Facts:
- Born in NYC and raised in New Jersey, I am very much a city person - love being around busy people with so much to do and see. (Now In Chicago!)
- Having studied Electrical and Computer Engineering at Rutgers University School of Engineering, I have a strong passion for IoT, hardware and connected devices.
- Been skiing since 5 years old and have never missed a season.
- Love the outdoors - hiking, rock climbing (indoors & out), soccer and windsurfing.
- Volunteer FireFighter/EMT for 7 years - belonged to my local Fire Department and Ambulance & Rescue Squad back in Jersey.

Volunteering with the goal of helping others has been a big part of making me who I am today.
**My personal goal is to push the bounds of hardware devices to enable others to achieve more by the safest means possible.**
