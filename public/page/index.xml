      <description>Hi, I&amp;rsquo;m Kevin Leung, a Technical Evangelist at Microsoft focused on developer communities, Software Engineering solutions and sparking innovation.
You can think of my role as an engineer by night, public speaker by day (though, I don&amp;rsquo;t have much superpowers). I truly enjoy deep diving in technology by helping students, startups and enterprises solve their most technically challenging problems while building content and demos to share the knowledge to a wider audience.</description>
